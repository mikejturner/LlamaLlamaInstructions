2nd Edition.

## Introduction

Players are shepherds that must bring together their flock of llamas to graze. Some llamas are full of fleas, which the shepherds try to avoid adding to their flock.

## Goal

At the end of each round, lead the flock of llamas back to your corral with the smallest number of fleas as possible.

## Contents

Each set contains 50 cards. The total number of fleas is 84.

* 15 llama cards numbered from 1 to 15 (without fleas).
* 13 llama cards numbered from 2 to 14 (with 1 flea).
* 11 llama cards numbered from 3 to 13 (with 2 fleas).
* 3 llama cards numbered from 7 to 9 (with 3 fleas).
* 8 special llama cards (with a superpower but also with 5 fleas!).

In addition:

* 1 arrow card that indicates the direction of play (whose turn is next).
* 3 instruction cards.
* 1 blank card for creating your own llama.

## How to play

Every shepherd receives 5 cards. If there are more than 5 players each receives only 4 cards. The remaining cards are left in a pile face down in the center of the table. The shepherd that starts the game puts the arrow card in front of himself/herself pointing to their neighbor to the left.

Place a card from your hand into the center of the table and take a card from the pile. Then taking turns, each shepherd adds a card with a number larger or smaller than the cards already played. Don't forget to take a new card from the pile after you have placed on down.

## Special Cards

The special llamas have 5 fleas (and have a red background).

### Blocking Llamas (numbers -1, 0 and 16)

Play these llamas to block the ends of the flock.

### Acrobatic Llamas

This llama can only be played on a llama that is already in the flock and has the same number as the acrobatic llama (7 or 9). It is placed above that card.

### Angry Llamas

The llama can be inserted in to an unoccupied position between two other cards. For example, between llamas 5 and 9, this card could be playing in positions 6, 7 or 8.

### The Surprised Llama

This llama can only be placed above a number 5 llama in the flock. At the end of the round, subtract 5 fleas from the total for that round. Add 5 fleas if the player still have the card in the hand at the end of the final round.

## Don't Forget!

Playing a special llama (on with 5 fleas) allows the shepherd to change the direction of the game if they want to. Turn the arrow card to point in the desired direction and that neighbor then plays the next turn.

## Leading the flock to pasture

A shepherd that CAN'T or DOESN'T WANT to add a llama takes all of the llamas in the flock and puts them face down in his/her corral in front of himself/herself and then starts a new flock. Each flea in your corral counts as one negative point ("point of shame").

## End of the round and of the game

When the last card from the pile has been played, the game is played until a shepherd takes the last flock. Then each shepherd collects together all the llamas in their corrals. Each shepherd counts all the fleas that their llamas have and writes down the score on a piece of paper. Keep playing until one player scores more then 100 points. The winner is the player with the lowest score.

It is normal for a losing player to express his/her shame and sadness with angry feelings.
